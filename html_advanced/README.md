# Techium - HTML Advanced Project

Welcome to the **Techium** project! In this project, you will learn how to structure web pages using HTML tags, creating a solid foundation for understanding web development. This project focuses exclusively on HTML structure without any CSS styling. 

**Note:** Pay close attention to details like lowercase vs uppercase letters, and other HTML syntax rules, as these are critical for HTML validation.

## ðŸ“š Resources

Make sure to review these resources to enhance your understanding of HTML:
- [HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
- [HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [HTML Reference - A free guide to all HTML elements and attributes](https://htmlreference.io/)
- [Can I useâ€¦ Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc](https://caniuse.com/)
- [HTML Cheat Sheet - WebsiteSetup](https://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand and follow HTML guidelines
- Create the basic structure of an HTML5 page
- Use semantic HTML tags to organize content on a web page
- Differentiate the use cases for `<div>` vs `<span>`
- Understand and apply the semantic values of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`
- Structure headings hierarchically and understand their importance
- Create lists in HTML (ordered, unordered, and definition lists)
- Recognize the differences between media types (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG)
- Use tables for structured data
- Integrate video and audio elements into a webpage
- Embed external content with `<iframe>`
- Structure an HTML document for optimal readability and functionality

## ðŸš€ Project Requirements

- **README.md** file at the project root is mandatory.
- Your HTML code must be W3C-compliant and pass the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- Techium is the fictional digital agency name used across all HTML files.

## ðŸ“‹ Sitemap and Wireframe

This project includes a sitemap and wireframe as part of the provided assets. Follow these structures to guide your development.

## Project Tasks

### Tasks Overview

Each task focuses on a specific part of the HTML document. You will progressively add structure to your HTML files, starting with the basics and moving towards a fully structured document. Below are examples of tasks you'll complete:

1. **Create the First Webpage**  
   - Set up `0-index.html` with the DOCTYPE, `<html>`, language, and direction attributes.

2. **Head and Body Sections**  
   - Add `<head>` and `<body>` sections to `1-index.html`.

3. **Meta, Title, and Favicon**  
   - Include charset, viewport, title, and favicon in `2-index.html`.

4. **Basic Structure: Header, Main, Footer**  
   - Organize your page into `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` sections in `3-index.html`.

5. **Add Navigation and Links**  
   - Set up `<nav>` links for page navigation and internal anchors.

### Sample Task: Add Social Media Links
- Copy `20-index.html` into `21-index.html`.
- Inside `<footer>`, create links to Techiumâ€™s social media profiles on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

...and so on.

Each task builds on the previous one, reinforcing HTML structuring skills by adding tags, elements, and specific attributes.

## Requirements

- **W3C Compliance:** Your code must validate with the W3C Validator.
- **Organization:** Follow the hierarchy and best practices outlined in the wireframe and sitemap.
